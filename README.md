## Description
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")  
Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!  
This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It is deployed to Heroku.

## Technology

1. Node.js:  
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

2. Sequelize:  
Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

3. MySQL:  
MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use.
  
4. Express-handlebars: Handlebars is one of the most used templating engines for web applications “competing” with other well-known ones like Mustache js, Pug, EJS and others. It’s especially used on the server side along with the express js framework.
  
5. Others: dotenv package(https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), bcrypt package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), express-session (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) & connect-session-sequelize (https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize).
